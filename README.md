# PDXLiveBus  

The PDXLiveBus app built in React.

This has been running on Meteor .4 (or something) for a long time now. Meteor is shutting down its free cloud so I rebuilt the front end and back end.

### Oh look React Native

So I just added react native into the repo it self. Both web and react native versions live in here.
Sharing the same code. The future is now?


### Running it

You'll need an API Key from here [http://developer.trimet.org/](http://developer.trimet.org/)

Then you'll need to run stuff with `APPID={APIKEYHERE} npm run dev`. Same goes for the server. Just needs to be on `process.env`. Why you care about this if you're not in Portland? Hell if I know.
